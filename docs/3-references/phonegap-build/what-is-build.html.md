# What is Build

Adobe PhoneGap provides a way for users to create mobile applications using technologies such as HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

Applications created with PhoneGap can be distributed to various vendor app stores (ex: Apple App Store) and installed on a end-user's device like any other native application.

Even though PhoneGap provides a intuitive and friendly way to create mobile applications, maintaining mobile development environment is still a hassle.

Each vendor provides a different toolchain, and each PhoneGap release is compatible with a specific set of tools.

This is where PhoneGap Build comes into help.

PhoneGap Build is a cloud service for compiling PhoneGap applications.

Here are some of the benifits PhoneGap Build provides:

## Managed Compilation and Signing

Local development involves installing and maintaining multiple native SDKs as well as the Cordova/PhoneGap SDK.

PhoneGap Build takes this headache away!

Get app-store ready apps without the headache of maintaining native SDKs. PhoneGap Build  will always be build against the required SDK for the platform
you are targeting.

## Multi-Platforms Support

Maximize your productivity while minimizing production time. Target iOS, Android, Windows Phone all with a single codebase.

## Work With Your Team

Work collaboratively by adding team members and create roles within your PhoneGap Build projects.

## Quicker Development Cycle

Use Hydration to get faster debug and build cycles. With Hydration, updates to your application be pushed directly to your testers' previously installed apps, ensuring everyone is working on the most up-to-date version.
